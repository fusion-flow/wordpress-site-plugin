<p>This is an example page. It's different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p>Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.)</p></blockquote>

<p>...or something like this:</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aphasia is an impairment of language, affecting the production or comprehension of speech and the ability to read or write. Aphasia is always due to injury to the brain-most commonly from a stroke, particularly in older individuals. But brain injuries resulting in aphasia may also arise from head trauma, from brain tumors, or from infections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/aphasia-facts/types-of-aphasia/"">Types of Aphasia</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over a century of experience with the study of aphasia has taught us that particular components of language may be particularly damaged in some individuals. We have also learned to recognize different types or patterns of aphasia that correspond to the location of the brain injury in the individual case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/aphasia-facts/global-aphasia"">Global aphasia</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the most severe form of aphasia, and is applied to patients who can produce few recognizable words and understand little or no spoken language. Persons with Global Aphasia can neither read nor write. Global aphasia may often be seen immediately after the patient has suffered a stroke and it may rapidly improve if the damage has not been too extensive. However, with greater brain damage, severe and lasting disability may result.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/aphasia-facts/brocas-aphasia/"">Broca's aphasia</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this form of aphasia, speech output is severely reduced and is limited mainly to short utterances of less than four words. Vocabulary access is limited and the formation of sounds by persons with Broca's aphasia is often laborious and clumsy. The person may understand speech relatively well and be able to read, but be limited in writing. Broca's aphasia is often referred to as a 'non fluent aphasia' because of the halting and effortful quality of speech.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/aphasia-facts/mixed-non-fluent-aphasia"">Mixed non-fluent aphasia</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This term is applied to patients who have sparse and effortful speech, resembling severe Broca's aphasia. However, unlike persons with Broca's aphasia, they remain limited in their comprehension of speech and do not read or write beyond an elementary level.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/aphasia-facts/wernickes-aphasia"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""80"">Wernicke's aphasia</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this form of aphasia the ability to grasp the meaning of spoken words is chiefly impaired, while the ease of producing connected speech is not much affected. Therefore Wernicke's aphasia is referred to as a 'fluent aphasia.' However, speech is far from normal. Sentences do not hang together and irrelevant words intrude-sometimes to the point of jargon, in severe cases. Reading and writing are often severely impaired.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/aphasia-facts/anomic-aphasia/"" data-type=""link"" data-id=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/aphasia-facts/anomic-aphasia/"">Anomic aphasia</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This term is applied to persons who are left with a persistent inability to supply the words for the very things they want to talk about-particularly the significant nouns and verbs. As a result their speech, while fluent in grammatical form and output is full of vague circumlocutions and expressions of frustration. They understand speech well, and in most cases, read adequately. Difficulty finding words is as evident in writing as in speech.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/aphasia-facts/primary-progressive-aphasia"">Primary Progressive Aphasia</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a neurological syndrome in which language capabilities become slowly and progressively impaired. Unlike other forms of aphasia that result from stroke or brain injury, PPA is caused by neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease or Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration. PPA results from deterioration of brain tissue important for speech and language. Although the first symptoms are problems with speech and language, other problems associated with the underlying disease, such as memory loss, often occur later.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/therapy/impairment-based-therapies/"">Impairment-based therapies</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A person with aphasia initially wants to speak better and make sense of language spoken by others. Therefore, speech-language pathologists attempt to repair what is broken. Therapies focus an individual’s attention on tasks that allow him or her to comprehend and speak as successfully as possible. A therapy session may be the only time of the day in which the mental mechanics of language are exercised with minimal frustration.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/therapy/communication-based-therapies/"">Communication-based therapies</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although someone with aphasia wants mostly to speak better, communication may still be frustrating. Communication oriented treatments, in part, assist the person in conveying messages and feelings with alternative means of communicating. This orientation is also said to involve compensatory strategies. In addition, an individual is encouraged to use any remaining language ability that succeeds in conveying messages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/therapy/impairment-based-contstraint-induced-therapy-cit/"">Impairment-based Contstraint-induced therapy (CIT)</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This therapy is modeled after a physical therapy for paralysis in which a patient is “forced,” for example, to use an impaired side of the body, because the good side has been restricted or constrained. In applying this principle to communication functions, a person with aphasia may be constrained in using intact gesture in order to direct the individual to use impaired spoken language.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/therapy/melodic-intonation-therapy-mit/"">Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT)</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Developed by Robert Sparks in Boston, MIT is based on an observation that that some persons with aphasia “sing it better than saying it.” The method is a series of steps in which an individual practices an artificially melodic production of sentences. It has been recommended for people with an expressive type of aphasia and good comprehension. We are careful to watch for the individual who speaks much better with melodic intonation but fails to carry this performance over to natural conversation.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This procedure is a slight variation of the basic picture-naming drill, but the adjustments introduce elements of conversation into the interaction These adjustments include the person with aphasia and the therapist taking turns conveying messages, pictures for messages hidden from the listener, and a free choice of modalities for conveying messages. Developed by Jeanne Wilcox and Albyn Davis in Memphis, it appears to have been popular in Europe where most studies have been conducted.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Developed by Audrey Holland in Arizona, this strategy aims at increasing commuunicative confidence through the practice of scripted conversations. With assistance from Leora Cherney in Chicago, this method has been integrated into a computer program. Called “AphasiaScripts,” it includes a virtual therapist to provide help for the person with aphasia.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Originated by Aura Kagan in Toronto, Canada, supported conversation is a particular strategy for enhancing communicative confidence that is commonly found in community support groups. Volunteers are trained to engage in real conversations with persons who have aphasia. Similar therapies have been described, called “conversation therapy” or “scaffolded conversations.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are plenty of ways to release your feelings when you have words at your disposal. You can write a journal, engage in talk therapy, or chat with a friend. But what do you do when you need to get a hold of your emotions and you don’t have words to calm you? You need visual coping techniques.<br>Lauren Marks tackles this issue in her book, A Stitch of Time (our current online book club selection). Her brain gives birth to a duck that she trots out whenever she needs to feel calm.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A collective term used to describe impairment in carrying out purposeful movements. People with severe aphasia are usually extremely limited in explaining themselves by pantomime or gesture, except for expressions of emotion. Commonly they will show you something in their wallet, or lead you to show you something, but this is the extent of their non-verbal communication.</p>

<p>Aphasia can be the result of a brain injury and may accompany damage after head trauma. This common complication may present differently for each individual. People with aphasia after a head injury often see improvement as the brain heals, and speech-language therapy treats lingering aphasia.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Refers to a group of speech disorders resulting from weakness, slowness, or incoordination of the speech mechanism due to damage to any of a variety of points in the nervous system. Dysarthria may involve disorders to some or all of the basic speech processes: respiration phonation, resonance, articulation, and prosody. Dysarthria is a disorder of speech production not language (e.g., use of vocabulary and/or grammar). Unlike apraxia of speech, the speech errors that occur in dysarthria are highly consistent.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Refers to those who have difficulty swallowing and may experience pain while swallowing. Some people may be completely unable to swallow or may have trouble swallowing liquids, foods, or saliva. Eating then becomes a challenge. Often, dysphagia makes it difficult to take in enough calories and fluids to nourish the body.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A condition of impairment of memory, intellect, personality, and insight resulting from brain injury or disease. Some forms of dementia are progressive, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Picks disease, or some forms of Parkinson’s disease. Language impairments are more or less prominent in different forms of dementia, but these are usually overshadowed by more widespread intellectual loss. Since dementia is so often a progressive disorder, the prognosis is quite different from aphasia.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stroke is the number one cause for aphasia, and 25% – 40% of stroke survivors develop aphasia. Just as hearts can experience a “heart attack,” brains can experience a “brain attack” when problems with blood flow to a section of the brain occurs. Bleeding in the left side of the brain can cause aphasia as the blood affects language centers in the brain. Luckily, the brain can sometimes form new channels of communication after sustaining damage in a section, and speech-language therapy can help patients regain communication skills.</p>

<p>APHASIA (Uh-Fay-Zhuh) is a result of a STROKE or BRAIN INJURY, and affects a person’s ability to communicate. It is important to remember that you are still a competent adult, you know what you want to say, you can make your own decisions and you are not deaf. Aphasia usually comes on suddenly from a stroke or brain injury. But in rare cases it may develop gradually. This is called Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). If you have aphasia, you may find it hard to: TALK, LISTEN/UNDERSTAND OTHERS WHEN THEY SPEAK, READ, WRITE, USE NUMBERS AND DO CALCULATIONS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aphasia is an impairment of language, affecting the production or comprehension of speech and the ability to read or write. Aphasia is always due to injury to the brain-most commonly from a stroke, particularly in older individuals. But brain injuries resulting in aphasia may also arise from head trauma, from brain tumors, or from infections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aphasia can be so severe as to make communication with the patient almost impossible, or it can be very mild. It may affect mainly a single aspect of language use, such as the ability to retrieve the names of objects, or the ability to put words together into sentences, or the ability to read. More commonly, however, multiple aspects of communication are impaired, while some channels remain accessible for a limited exchange of information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is the job of the professional to determine the amount of function available in each of the channels for the comprehension of language, and to assess the possibility that treatment might enhance the use of the channels that are available.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over a century of experience with the study of aphasia has taught us that particular components of language may be particularly damaged in some individuals. We have also learned to recognize different types or patterns of aphasia that correspond to the location of the brain injury in the individual case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/aphasia-facts/global-aphasia"">Global aphasia</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the most severe form of aphasia, and is applied to patients who can produce few recognizable words and understand little or no spoken language. Persons with Global Aphasia can neither read nor write. Global aphasia may often be seen immediately after the patient has suffered a stroke and it may rapidly improve if the damage has not been too extensive. However, with greater brain damage, severe and lasting disability may result.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/aphasia-facts/brocas-aphasia/"">Broca's aphasia</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this form of aphasia, speech output is severely reduced and is limited mainly to short utterances of less than four words. Vocabulary access is limited and the formation of sounds by persons with Broca's aphasia is often laborious and clumsy. The person may understand speech relatively well and be able to read, but be limited in writing. Broca's aphasia is often referred to as a 'non fluent aphasia' because of the halting and effortful quality of speech.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/aphasia-facts/mixed-non-fluent-aphasia"">Mixed non-fluent aphasia</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This term is applied to patients who have sparse and effortful speech, resembling severe Broca's aphasia. However, unlike persons with Broca's aphasia, they remain limited in their comprehension of speech and do not read or write beyond an elementary level.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/aphasia-facts/wernickes-aphasia"" data-type=""page"" data-id=""80"">Wernicke's aphasia</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this form of aphasia the ability to grasp the meaning of spoken words is chiefly impaired, while the ease of producing connected speech is not much affected. Therefore Wernicke's aphasia is referred to as a 'fluent aphasia.' However, speech is far from normal. Sentences do not hang together and irrelevant words intrude-sometimes to the point of jargon, in severe cases. Reading and writing are often severely impaired.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This term is applied to persons who are left with a persistent inability to supply the words for the very things they want to talk about-particularly the significant nouns and verbs. As a result their speech, while fluent in grammatical form and output is full of vague circumlocutions and expressions of frustration. They understand speech well, and in most cases, read adequately. Difficulty finding words is as evident in writing as in speech.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://fusionflow2.local/resource-categories/aphasia-facts/primary-progressive-aphasia"">Primary Progressive Aphasia</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a neurological syndrome in which language capabilities become slowly and progressively impaired. Unlike other forms of aphasia that result from stroke or brain injury, PPA is caused by neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease or Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration. PPA results from deterioration of brain tissue important for speech and language. Although the first symptoms are problems with speech and language, other problems associated with the underlying disease, such as memory loss, often occur later.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aphasia is an impairment of language, affecting the production or comprehension of speech and the ability to read or write. Aphasia is always due to injury to the brain-most commonly from a stroke, particularly in older individuals. But brain injuries resulting in aphasia may also arise from head trauma, from brain tumors, or from infections.</p>

<p>Although someone with aphasia wants mostly to speak better, communication may still be frustrating. Communication oriented treatments, in part, assist the person in conveying messages and feelings with alternative means of communicating. This orientation is also said to involve compensatory strategies. In addition, an individual is encouraged to use any remaining language ability that succeeds in conveying messages.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This therapy is modeled after a physical therapy for paralysis in which a patient is “forced,” for example, to use an impaired side of the body, because the good side has been restricted or constrained. In applying this principle to communication functions, a person with aphasia may be constrained in using intact gesture in order to direct the individual to use impaired spoken language.</p>

<p>Developed by Robert Sparks in Boston, MIT is based on an observation that that some persons with aphasia “sing it better than saying it.” The method is a series of steps in which an individual practices an artificially melodic production of sentences. It has been recommended for people with an expressive type of aphasia and good comprehension. We are careful to watch for the individual who speaks much better with melodic intonation but fails to carry this performance over to natural conversation.</p>

<p>This procedure is a slight variation of the basic picture-naming drill, but the adjustments introduce elements of conversation into the interaction These adjustments include the person with aphasia and the therapist taking turns conveying messages, pictures for messages hidden from the listener, and a free choice of modalities for conveying messages.

<p>To overcome depression, you can follow the following steps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Understanding Feelings: It's important to know that feeling sad or down is okay, and you're not alone. Sometimes, talking to someone who understands how you feel can help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Talking Therapy: Some people find it helpful to talk to a therapist who can help them understand their feelings and find ways to feel better. They might use pictures or simple words to help you express yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Talking with Others: Being around others who understand what it's like to have trouble talking can make you feel less alone. You might join a group where everyone can share their feelings and support each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Help from Medicines: Sometimes, doctors prescribe medicines that can help with sad feelings. They'll talk to you and your family about how these medicines can help and any side effects to watch out for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Learning Relaxation: There are simple ways to relax your body and mind, like taking slow breaths or tensing and relaxing your muscles. These can help you feel calmer when you're feeling sad or stressed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doing Activities: Finding things you enjoy and can do can help lift your mood. It could be listening to music, drawing, or spending time with loved ones. Doing things you like can bring joy and make you feel better.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking Small Steps: It's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to feel better all at once. Each small step you take can bring you closer to feeling happier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting Help: If you're feeling really down and nothing seems to help, it's important to talk to someone who can help you, like a doctor or therapist. They can work with you to find the best way to feel better.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A person with aphasia initially wants to speak better and make sense of language spoken by others. Therefore, speech-language pathologists attempt to repair what is broken. Therapies focus an individual’s attention on tasks that allow him or her to comprehend and speak as successfully as possible. A therapy session may be the only time of the day in which the mental mechanics of language are exercised with minimal frustration.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although someone with aphasia wants mostly to speak better, communication may still be frustrating. Communication oriented treatments, in part, assist the person in conveying messages and feelings with alternative means of communicating. This orientation is also said to involve compensatory strategies. In addition, an individual is encouraged to use any remaining language ability that succeeds in conveying messages.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This therapy is modeled after a physical therapy for paralysis in which a patient is “forced,” for example, to use an impaired side of the body, because the good side has been restricted or constrained. In applying this principle to communication functions, a person with aphasia may be constrained in using intact gesture in order to direct the individual to use impaired spoken language.</p>

<p>A collective term used to describe impairment in carrying out purposeful movements. People with severe aphasia are usually extremely limited in explaining themselves by pantomime or gesture, except for expressions of emotion. Commonly they will show you something in their wallet, or lead you to show you something, but this is the extent of their non-verbal communication.</p>

<p>Specific examination usually shows that they are unable to perform common expressive gestures on request, such as waving good-bye, beckoning, or saluting, or to pantomime drinking, brushing teeth, etc. (limb apraxia).

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This disorder may even extend to the inability to manipulate real objects. More often, however, apraxia is not very apparent unless one asks the patient to perform or imitate a pretended action.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Refers to a group of speech disorders resulting from weakness, slowness, or incoordination of the speech mechanism due to damage to any of a variety of points in the nervous system. Dysarthria may involve disorders to some or all of the basic speech processes: respiration phonation, resonance, articulation, and prosody. Dysarthria is a disorder of speech production not language (e.g., use of vocabulary and/or grammar). Unlike apraxia of speech, the speech errors that occur in dysarthria are highly consistent.</p>

<p>Refers to those who have difficulty swallowing and may experience pain while swallowing. Some people may be completely unable to swallow or may have trouble swallowing liquids, foods, or saliva.

<p>A condition of impairment of memory, intellect, personality, and insight resulting from brain injury or disease. Some forms of dementia are progressive, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Picks disease, or some forms of Parkinson’s disease. Language impairments are more or less prominent in different forms of dementia, but these are usually overshadowed by more widespread intellectual loss. Since dementia is so often a progressive disorder, the prognosis is quite different from aphasia.</p>

<p>Stroke</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stroke is the number one cause for aphasia, and 25% – 40% of stroke survivors develop aphasia. Just as hearts can experience a “heart attack,” brains can experience a “brain attack” when problems with blood flow to a section of the brain occurs. Bleeding in the left side of the brain can cause aphasia as the blood affects language centers in the brain. Luckily, the brain can sometimes form new channels of communication after sustaining damage in a section, and speech-language therapy can help patients regain communication skills.</p>
